# Description:
# Encrypt this!

# You want to create secret messages which can be deciphered by the Decipher this! kata. Here are the conditions:

# Your message is a string containing space separated words.
# You need to encrypt each word in the message using the following rules:
# The first letter must be converted to its ASCII code.
# The second letter must be switched with the last letter
# Keepin' it simple: There are no special characters in the input.
# Examples:
# encrypt_this("Hello") == "72olle"
# encrypt_this("good") == "103doo"
# encrypt_this("hello world") == "104olle 119drlo"

def encrypt_this(text)
  text.gsub(/(\w{1})(\w)?(\w*?)(\w)?\b/) { "#{$1.ord.to_s}#{$4}#{$3}#{$2}" }
end
